Requirements

- Python 2.7.x 
- neurosynth (github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth)
 Note: Install directly from github: pip install git+https://github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth.git
- Scipy/Numpy
- nibabel 1.x (2.x will NOT work)

For visualization:

- matplotlib
- pysurfer
  - Note, pysurfer can be difficult to install. Feel free to visualize using nilearn or your package of choice instead. I've had success installing it under canopy.

Unzip pre-generated Neurosynth dataset prior to analysis (data.zip)
